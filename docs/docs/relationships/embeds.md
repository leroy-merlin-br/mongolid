## Embeds One

An Embeds One relationship is a very basic relation.
For example, a `User` model might have one `Phone`.
We can define this relation in Mongolid:

### Defining An Embeds One Relation

```php
    class Person extends \Mongolid\Model\AbstractModel {
        // This model is saved in the collection people
        protected $collection = 'people';
    
        // Method that will be used to access the phone
        public function phone()
        {
            // highlight-next-line
            return $this->embedsOne(Phone::class, 'phone');
        }
    }
    
    class Phone extends \Mongolid\Model\AbstractModel {
        // This model will be embedded only
        protected $collection = null;
    
        public function getFullPhone()
        {
            return '+' . $this->regionCode . $this->number;
        }
    }
```

The first argument passed to the `embedsOne` method is the name of the related model.
The second argument is in what attribute that object will be embedded.
Once the relationship is defined, we can retrieve and embed documents.

### To retrieve an embedded document:

1. First we get the relation:

    ```php
        $relation = User::find('4af9f23d8ead0e1d32000000')->phone();
    ```

    :::info **Explanation**:

    - Query for the user with the `_id` _'4af9f23d8ead0e1d32000000'_
    - The `phone()` method will return an `EmbedsOne` instance, that is extended of an `AbstractRelation` class.
    - That is, the relationship we were trying to obtain.
    :::

2. Then we can obtain the model this way:

    ```php
        $phone = $relation->get();
    ```
    
    OR inline:

    ```php
        $phone = User::find('4af9f23d8ead0e1d32000000')->phone()->get();
    ```

    :::info **Explanation**

    - Instantiate a **Phone** object with the attributes found in `phone` attribute of the user
    - Return that object
    :::

### In order to embed a document:

```php
    // The object that will be embedded
    $phone = new Phone();
    $phone->regionCode = '55';
    $phone->number = '1532323232';
    
    // The object that will contain the phone
    $user = User::first('4af9f23d8ead0e1d32000000');
    
    // This method will embed the $phone into the phone attribute of the user
    // highlight-next-line
    $user->phone()->add($phone);
    
    $user->save();
    
    // Now we can retrieve the relationship by calling
    $user->phone(); // Will return Embeds object
```

:::info
When using Mongolid models you will need to call the `save()` method after embeding or attaching objects. 
The changes will only persist after you call the 'save()' method.

## Embeds many

An example of an Embeds Many relation is a blog post that "has many" comments. We can model this relation like so:

```php
    class Post extends \Mongolid\Model\AbstractModel {
        protected $collection = 'posts';
    
        public function comments()
        {
            // highlight-next-line
            return $this->embedsMany(Comment::class, 'comments');
        }
    
    }
    
    class Comment extends \Mongolid\Model\AbstractModel {
        // This model will be embedded only
        protected $collection = null;
    }
```

Now we can access the post's comments `EmbeddedCursor` through the comments method:

```php
    $comments = Post::find('4af9f23d8ead0e1d32000000')->comments()->get();
```

Now you can iterate and perform cursor operations in the `EmbeddedCursor` that is retrieved

```php
    foreach($comments->limit(10) as $comment)
    {
        // do something
    }
```

Once you have the EmbedsMany relationship, you are able to use the methods of this object in order to manipulate this embedded documents.

Like:

```php
->add();
->addMany();
->replace();
->remove();
->removeAll();
->get();
```

```php
    $commentA = new Comment();
    $commentA->content = 'Cool feature bro!';
    
    $commentB = new Comment();
    $commentB->content = 'Awesome!';
    
    $post = Post::first('4af9f23d8ead0e1d32000000');
    
    // Add one comment
    $post->comments()->add($commentA);
    
    // Add multiple comments
    $post->comments()->addMany([$commentA, $commentB]);
    
    // Replace all comments already exists
    $post->comments()->replace([$commentA, $commentB]);
    
    // In order to remove a comment
    $post->comments()->remove($commentB);
    
    // To remove all comments
    $post->comments()->removeAll();
    
    $post->save();
```
